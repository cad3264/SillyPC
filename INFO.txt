This is just purely meant to be a large place to refer to when creating stuff for SillyPC

File formats:
SillyPC runs off of a file format named "SSBLF", which stands for: [S]uper [S]illy [B]ase [L]evel [F]ormat
SSBLF is a lua-like programming language, with FULL CONTROL over the system.
the SSBLF file format is NOT safe to run, as it can: Crash the PC, Delete the file system, or just generally do something bad
However, if you do sandbox it, it can be safe as long as certain permissons are limited or removed
Most likely though, you will want to create your own language for users
